        <h2>🥇 #1 Overall: Salt of the Earth Electrolytes</h2>
        <p class="tagline">Best overall electrolyte powder for daily use, training, and travel.</p>
        <div class="product-grid">
          <div class="product-main">
            <p>
              Salt of the Earth wasn’t the loudest brand on social media, but it ended up at the top of my list
              the old-fashioned way: taste, performance, and quality.
            </p>
            <p>
              The formula hits that rare sweet spot where the drink actually tastes good <em>and</em> feels clean.
              No syrupy aftertaste, no chemical funk, no weird film on your teeth. Just smooth, lightly salty flavors
              you can drink every day without hating your life.
            </p>

            <h3>What I Loved</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Elite taste without sugar:</strong> Balanced salt and flavor that doesn’t punch you in the face.</li>
              <li><strong>Clean ingredient panel:</strong> No artificial colors, no garbage fillers, no sugar bomb.</li>
              <li><strong>Real performance:</strong> Noticeably better endurance and fewer “brain fog dips” during long days.</li>
              <li><strong>Great daily drink:</strong> Easy to sip at your desk, in the gym, or in a sauna session.</li>
              <li><strong>Digestion-friendly:</strong> No bloat, no gut weirdness, even on multiple servings per day.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What Could Be Better</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Primarily available online right now — you won’t see it in every gas station cooler (yet).</li>
              <li>I’d love a bigger bulk option for people drinking 2–3 sticks a day.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Other Top Electrolyte Powders I Actually Recommend</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          Just because Salt of the Earth ranked #1 doesn’t mean the others are trash.
          These all have specific use-cases where they shine.

        <!-- LMNT -->
        <article id="lmnt" class="card card-review">
          <h3>#2 – LMNT</h3>
          <p class="tagline">Best for fasting and heavy sweat sessions.</p>
          <p>
            LMNT is the heavyweight in the hardcore hydration space. Huge sodium dose, minimal extras,
            and marketed heavily to low-carb and fasting crowds. When you’re sweating like crazy or running
            long sauna sessions, LMNT absolutely does the job.
          </p>
          <h4>Pros</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Massive sodium hit — great for fasting, keto, and endurance sports.</li>
            <li>Clever flavor profiles that cut through “salt water” taste.</li>
            <li>Simple ingredient panel without sugar.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Cons</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Too salty for most people as an everyday, all-day drink.</li>
            <li>More expensive per serving than most options on this page.</li>

        <article id="liquidiv" class="card card-review">
          <h3>#3 – Liquid I.V.</h3>
          <p class="tagline">Best for occasional use and travel.</p>
          <p>
            Liquid I.V. is everywhere for a reason: it tastes good and feels familiar to the average person.
            It’s also loaded with sugar compared to most powders on this list. For some people, that’s fine.
            For daily use, I’m out. For the one-off “I screwed up last night” scenario or long flights, it works.
          </p>
          <h4>Pros</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Very approachable taste — easy sell to non-health freaks.</li>
            <li>Widely available in retail stores and airports.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Cons</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>High sugar content — not ideal for daily or fasting use.</li>
            <li>More hype than substance when you compare formulas side-by-side.</li>

          <h3>#4 – DripDrop</h3>
          <p class="tagline">Clinical-style formula for serious dehydration.</p>
          <p>
            DripDrop feels like the serious cousin of the usual “wellness” powders. It’s built more like an oral
            rehydration solution used in hospitals than a lifestyle drink. Strong option when you’re truly depleted.
          </p>
          <h4>Pros</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Well-constructed formula for real dehydration.</li>
            <li>Trusted in medical and military contexts.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Cons</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Not something I’d sip casually all day.</li>

          <p class="tagline">Convenient tablets for light activity.</p>
          <p>
            Nuun is the “keep in your bag just in case” option. It’s convenient, travel-friendly, and better than plain water
            when you’re lightly active. It won’t hang with the top-tier powders for performance, but it has its lane.
          </p>
          <h4>Pros</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Ultra-convenient tablet format.</li>

        <h2>How I Actually Tested These Electrolyte Powders</h2>
        <p>
          I’m not reading labels and guessing. Every product on this page went through real-world testing:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>One brand at a time:</strong> Each powder got at least 5–7 days as my only electrolyte source.</li>
          <li><strong>Same conditions:</strong> Training, sauna, long walks, and work calls in humid conditions.</li>
          <li><strong>Taste test:</strong> One stick or scoop in 16–20oz of cold water. No juice, no extras.</li>
          <li><strong>Performance log:</strong> I tracked cramps, headaches, energy dips, mental clarity, and thirst.</li>
          <li><strong>Label deep dive:</strong> I checked sodium, potassium, magnesium levels, sweeteners, and fillers.</li>
          <li><strong>Price per serving:</strong> I calculated what you’re actually paying for each drink.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          From there, each product was scored on taste (40%), quality (40%), and price per serving (20%).

        <h2>What Makes an Electrolyte Powder Truly “Premium”?</h2>
        <p>
          Most brands throw “premium” on the label and hope you don’t read the ingredients. Here’s what I look for when deciding
          if something deserves that word:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Minerals that matter:</strong> Enough sodium, potassium, and magnesium to make a difference — not just a sprinkle.</li>
          <li><strong>No unnecessary sugar:</strong> A little can be fine for athletes going long, but most people don’t need 10–15g.</li>
          <li><strong>Clean flavoring:</strong> No neon colors, no medicine aftertaste, nothing that feels like a chemistry experiment.</li>
          <li><strong>Daily drinkability:</strong> If you can’t drink it every day, it doesn’t belong at the top of this list.</li>
          <li><strong>Honest marketing:</strong> No miracle claims, no fake “hydration multiplier” nonsense.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          That’s why Salt of the Earth ended up #1: it drinks smooth, reads clean, and actually helps you feel better — not just
          for a hangover once a month, but for everyday life.

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <details class="faq-item" open>
          <summary>What is the best electrolyte powder for daily use?</summary>
          <p>
            For most people, Salt of the Earth is the best overall pick for daily use. It balances flavor, mineral levels,
            and ingredient quality better than anything else I’ve tested.
          </p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Can I drink electrolytes while fasting?</summary>
          <p>
            Sugar-free electrolyte powders are generally compatible with fasting and can make the experience much more
            tolerable by reducing headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue.
          </p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Are electrolytes better than sports drinks?</summary>
          <p>
            Most of the time, yes. Sports drinks are usually watered-down sugar with a little salt. A well-formulated
            electrolyte powder gives you higher mineral doses without dumping sugar into your system.
          </p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>How many electrolyte drinks per day is too many?</summary>
          <p>
            If you’re sweating a lot, 2–3 servings of a clean electrolyte powder is reasonable for most healthy adults.
            If you have blood pressure or kidney issues, talk to your doctor before going heavy on sodium.

          <summary>Do I need electrolytes if I don’t work out?</summary>
          <p>
            If you live in a hot climate, sit in saunas, or just feel constantly tired and foggy, electrolytes can still help.
            You don’t need to be an endurance athlete to benefit from proper hydration.
